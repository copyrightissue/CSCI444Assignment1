<div><p>My hypothesis was that as GDP of a country increased so did the prevalence of diabetes.
  Here I graphed the GDP of a selection of countries against their percentage of the population with diagnosed diabetes and discovered
  that the trend is opposite.
  The smaller a countries GDP the more of their population is effected by diabetes. The data however is heavily skewed in the positive direction,
  there are many more poorer countries then wealthy ones. </p>
