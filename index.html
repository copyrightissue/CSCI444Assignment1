<div><p>My hypothesis was that as GDP of a country increases so would the prevalence of diabetes.
  Here, I graphed the GDP of a selection of countries against their percentage of the population with diagnosed diabetes and discovered that the trend is opposite to my hypothesis.
  The smaller a country's GDP, the higher the percentage of the population is effected by diabetes.
  The data is heavily skewed in the positive direction because there are many more countries with low GDP then there are wealthy ones. </p>
